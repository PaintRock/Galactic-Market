# The Idea

My idea is a marketplace that transports users to a movie-themed planet. Each planet represents a different movie universe, such as Wakanda, Mars, Planet of the Apes, Jurasic Park, and so on.

## Front End
The front end will fetch data from The Movie Database to display images and information about the movies.

## Back End
The back end will utilize MongoDB to store prices and other relevant data retrieved from the database.

# The Tools

I plan to use the following tools and technologies:
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS

# Timeframes

Here are the estimated timeframes for different tasks:
- **4 hours** - Documentation
- **100 hours** - Coding
- **8 hours** - Slides/Presentations Preparation
